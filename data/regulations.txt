Client Suitability and Appropriateness Policy

1. Objective
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all investment products and services offered to clients align with their individual investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance, and experience in the financial markets. This policy is in compliance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), and aims to uphold the integrity and trustworthiness of the firm in all client interactions.

2. Client Categorization
Clients must be categorized as Retail Clients, Professional Clients, or Eligible Counterparties before any transactions are conducted. This categorization determines the level of protection afforded to the client under applicable regulations. Retail Clients are offered the highest degree of regulatory protection, while Eligible Counterparties receive the least. The categorization process involves assessing the client’s knowledge and experience, financial situation, and investment objectives.

3. Suitability Assessment
Before recommending or executing a transaction on behalf of a client, the firm must assess the suitability of the proposed investment. This includes:
	•	Understanding Client Profiles: Collecting detailed information through Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to assess financial stability, investment goals, and risk tolerance.
	•	Product Assessment: Ensuring the financial instrument aligns with the client’s needs and that the client is fully aware of any associated risks.
	•	Documentation and Record-Keeping: Maintaining thorough records of suitability assessments for a minimum of five years, as required by regulatory authorities.

4. Appropriateness Test
For non-advised services, an appropriateness test must be conducted to evaluate whether the client possesses the knowledge and experience necessary to understand the risks associated with a financial instrument. If the test indicates a lack of understanding, the client must be informed of the potential unsuitability of the product.

5. Ongoing Monitoring
Client profiles and suitability assessments must be reviewed periodically, especially in response to significant changes in market conditions or the client’s circumstances. It is the responsibility of Relationship Managers to ensure that client information is current and accurate.

6. Conflicts of Interest
The firm must avoid conflicts of interest when advising clients. Where conflicts cannot be avoided, they must be disclosed in a clear and transparent manner. The firm’s Conflicts of Interest Policy outlines the procedures to identify, mitigate, and disclose such conflicts.

7. Breach and Non-Compliance
Failure to adhere to this policy will result in internal investigations and may lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment or engagement. Furthermore, breaches may be reported to regulatory authorities as required.
